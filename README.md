# Diffusion Coefficient Estimation with Double Data
Welcome to the repository for my project on Diffusion Coefficient Estimation, developed as part of my research in PDE-constrained optimization and data assimilation. This project focuses on estimating eddy diffusion coefficients using multi-source data, leveraging adjoint-based methods and optimization techniques.

Key features of this repository include:

* Implementation of numerical methods for solving inverse problems.
* Use of dual data to improve accuracy in diffusion coefficient estimation.
* Scripts and examples demonstrating the integration of real-world datasets.
